# Ballbot-Project
This project is an adaptation to the Ballbot project done by a few 
University of Adelaide students. This adaptation uses the 
arduino MEGA platform (instead of the Lego Mindstorms NXT brick),
a motor shield from Adafruit,and the IMU sensor from Adafruit. The 
other components (excluding a few circuits built for the project) 
are similar to the UA students' project.

Part of the code comes from the control theory diagrams located in the
appendix of the UA students report. This piece of the code was generated
through Simulink. Simulink created multiple files just for the control
portion, and these generated files are also located in the repository (very
necessary to run the full code). The other portions of the code were made entirely
by myself and my collaborator.
